"The Three Body problem" 
This problem involves the solution of a system of three gravitational bodies with the use of 
numerical methods. In this case I decided to use Runge-Kutta of 2nd Order to solve this problem. 
There are various cases enlisted in this code, and the user can edit the code so to decide what
initial conditions they want to apply to the system.
